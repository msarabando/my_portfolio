    <h1>The Projects I've Created</h1>

    <p>While learning how to code at Prudential, there are many projects that i've craeated to get me started in the coding world. I've used programs such as Scratch, Python, Arduino, HTML and CSS. These programs showed me the building blocks of coding, helped me create games in the command prompt, taught me how to code a robot and guided me to creating a webpage. Take a look at the programs i used while learning how to code.  </p>


  <div id=Scratch>
      <h2>Scratch</h2>

      <p>Here you see about three projects i've created using Scratch. This website really taught me the buliding blocks of coding. I learned about variables, loops, conditionals and many other things about coding through these projects. </p>

  <p>These are some basic projects that i have created using Scratch. This is what i made in the first week of actually learning how to code. They are not the most intricate but i am proud of everything i created using Scratch.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=Python>
      <h2>Python</h2>

      <p>The second week of coding, i learned how to use the language Python. This is a programming language used by many softwear developers so it was really cool to work with such a universal language. </p>

  <section class=columns>
    <h4>How Old Are You Challenge</h4>
        <div class=images>
            <img src="./images.html/how old are you.jpg" alt="HOAY" width:"400px" height="400px"/>
        </div>

  </section>

  <section class=columns>
    <h4>Fizz Buzz Challenge</h4>
        <div class=images>
          <img src="./images.html/fizz buzz.jpg" alt="FB" width:"400px" height="400px"/>
        </div>

  </section>

  <section class=columns>
    <h4>Hangman Challenge</h4>
      <div class=images>
          <img src="./images.html/hangman.jpg" alt="HM" width:"400px" height="400px"/>
      </div>
  </section>

  <p>These are basic coding challenges that every softwear programer usually does at a job interview. The employer might want  to see how one indents and alines their text and code. </p>
  </div>
  </br>

  <div id=Arudino>
      <h2>Arudino</h2>

  <section class=columns_1>
        <h4>Sensor Challenge</h4>
          <div class=images>
              <img src="./images.html/cat whiskers.jpg" alt="CW" width:"400px" height="400px"/>
          </div>
  </section>


  <section class=columns_1>
      <h4>LED Challenge</h4>
          <div class=images>
              <img src="./images.html/Led.jpg" alt="LEd" width:"400px" height="400px"/>
          </div>
  </section>

  <p>Arudino is a language used for coding robots. While you also have put your wires and resistors in their spots respectively, you also have to get the correct code to make your robot to move how you want it to. </p>
  </div>

  <div id=HTMLandCSS>
      <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>

  <section class=columns_1>
      <h4>Cat Website Code</h4>
          <div class=images>
              <img src="./images.html/Cat website.jpg" alt="CW" width:"400px" height="400px"/>
          </div>
  </section>
  <section class=columns_1>
      <h4>Cat Website</h4>
          <div class=images>
              <img src="./images.html/cats are better than you.jpg" alt="CABTY" width:"400px" height="400px"/>
          </div>
  </section>

  <p>Only having just worked with HTML, i created this basic website on why i believe cats are better than dogs. It has lists that are ordered and unordered, paragraphs, links and all kinds of things in the header, body and footer. This was my first project when it comes to coding with HTML but i have more projects on the way that include CSS.</p>
